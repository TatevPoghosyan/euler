Euler's Method Numerical Solver

Overview

This Python implementation of Euler's method provides a numerical solution to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form y' = f(x, y) with given initial conditions (Cauchy problems). The code is designed for educational purposes and practical applications in scientific computing.

Features

Simple Implementation: 
Clean, easy-to-understand implementation of Euler's method

Adaptive Step Handling:
Automatically adjusts the final step to exactly reach the target point

Verbose Output:
Prints intermediate y-values during computation

Example Included: 
Comes with a sample differential equation (y' = -y) for demonstration
